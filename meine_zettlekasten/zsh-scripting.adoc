= ZSH scripting

I learned a lot when making tmux scripts at Odeko for optimizing my workflow

= Arrays

` myArray=(   "such"   "wow"   "so"   "much"   "stuff" ) `

== Iteration

Using the above as an example source: ` for thing in $myArray;
do   # whatever done `

= Conditionals

This is really for checking if an environmental var is present `+ if [[ -z "${WORK}" ]];
then   # do stuff fi +`

= Early return

Use `return` and not `exit` `exit` will quit your entire shell session

= Variables

``` # string variable myStr="This is a string"

= saving the output of a command to a variable

# below will run the command "tput lines" and save the result to "lines" lines=$(tput lines) ```

You can reference variables in your script using `$varName` So using lines above would result in `$lines`

*NOTE:* There is a difference between `$myVar` and `"$myVar"` (the double quotes) Wrapping the variable in double quotes makes it a string Without the quotes the contents of the variable may be executed immediately
