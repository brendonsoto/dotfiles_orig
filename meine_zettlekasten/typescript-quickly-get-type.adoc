= How to quickly get the type of something

For context, I was struggling finding the type of `setTimeout` to use for a variable to hold timeout ids.
I found there's a function called `ReturnType` that can be used to get the type for basically anything.
So in practice, it looks like `const timeoutId: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> = setTimeout(myFunc, time)`.
