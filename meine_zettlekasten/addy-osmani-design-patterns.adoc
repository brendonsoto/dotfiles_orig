== Anti Patterns

There's a quote by some Alexander guy stating there's a balance between form and context.
Context being what defines the problem and form being the solution.

Examples: - Global namespace pollution - Modifying `Object` class prototype - Inline JS

== Categories of Design Pattern

Creational: - Constructor - Factory - Abstract - Prototype - Singleton - Builder

Structional (composition and relationship between objects): - Decorator - Facade - Flyweight - Adapter - Proxy

Behavioral (communication between objects): - Iterator - Mediator - Observer - Visitor
