= Type Alias

A type alias is a way to refer to a datatype by another name.
So it's like giving datatypes nicknames.
For instance, `type Coordinate = (Integer, Integer)` is a way to have a value of type `Tuple Integer Integer`, but refer to it by the name `Coordinate`.
It can make it easier to refer to types at times.
