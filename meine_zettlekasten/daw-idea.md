# DAW Idea
This was inspired by Bret Victor's Ladder of Abstraction piece.
In particular, reading "A designer needs direct, interactive control over the independent variables of the system. We must not be slaves to real time." The context of that quote was comparing a recording/video of a system interacting in real time vs having a tool that allows you to essentially step through time to observe the various states of the system.

What if there was a DAW that operated on modes?
Its default mode would be record mode where anything played is recorded and saved as a "clip", like in Bitwig/Ableton.
There can be a playback mode where the mouse acts like a scrub tool over waveforms. You can highlight an area of a track or tracks and the highlighted areas will play in time together.
