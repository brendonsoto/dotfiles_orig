= Detecting Bottlenecks

_NOTE_ Requires full erlang to be installed, not erlang-nox (headless)

If you start up a server with iex, `iex -S mix phx.server`, and then in the iex session run `observer.start()` a GUI should appear showing a dashboard of the running applications.
This is like the unix command `top` but for Elixir processes.

For *bottlenecks* you want to pay attention to the Message Queue (MsgQ) and make sure it's at a reasonable/low number.
A high number may indicate a bottleneck.
