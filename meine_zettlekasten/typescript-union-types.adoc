= Union Types

Think of union types as types connected through the use of _or_.
A type is this _or_ that.
Union types are _product_ types, more-or-less.
I say more-or-less because when in use without type guards, only the properties shared between the types is directly accessible in the function.
To access unique properties, or properties not shared by all types in the union, type guards or type predicates are needed.

Example of type predicate: `+function isCustomer(user: Admin | Customer): user is Customer { ...
}+`

Example of type guard: ` function getCust(user: Admin | Customer) {   if (typeof user === "Admin") {     // Do Admin things   }   if (typeof user === "Customer") {     // Do Customer things   }   throw new Error("Invalid user") } `
