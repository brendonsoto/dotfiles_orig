:postgresql:database:

= Basics

This builds off of the xref:./postgresql-install.adoc[basic installation]

Once that's set up, you may want to inspect the db The `psql` command is supposed to be the interface to the db

The default user is the _postgres_ user So if you tried running `psql` from your regular user, say "User", you'll see a message saying "No role 'User' exists"

To get around this run `sudo -u postgres -i` This will give you sudo privileges and masquerade yourself as the `postgres` user

_Now_ you can run `psql`

For help, run `/?` The prompt is pretty helpful from there.

To save some time: - `\l`: list databases - `\c <database>`: use database `<database>` - `\dt`: show tables
