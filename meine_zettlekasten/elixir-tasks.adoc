= Tasks

Tasks are functions that run in the background

== When to Use

Use Tasks and xref:./elixir-agents.adoc[Agents] when dealing with specific background activities You can wrap them in modules to make them interchangeable with GenServer modules

== What They're About

So far they seem like promises and async/await from JavaScript I say this because the syntax looks like this: `+ worker = Task.async(Module, func, [args]) # The above can also be written as: # worker = Task.async(fn -> Module.func(args)) result = Task.await(worker) +`

Tasks are OTP servers under the hood This means they can be added to supervisors

== Linking Tasks

If a task is _linked_ using `start_link` and _fails_ then the whole process terminates immediately When using `Task.async` the entire process will fail when the failed async'd function is referenced in the `await` call
