= Installation

This is a weird point.
There's the Haskell Platform (HP) which a good chunk of people recommend, but a lot of people have reported problems using HP.
It seems like the minimal set of tools needed are _GHC_, _Stack_, and _Cabal_.
Installing Stack should install the others, or through the use of a tool called `ghcup`.

GHC is the compiler.
GHCi is the REPL.
Use `ghci` to access the REPL.
Some helpful commands: - To load a file:   * `ghci myFile.hs`   * (in ghci) `> :load myFile.hs` -- shortcut = `:l` - To reload a file within ghci: `ghci :reload` -- shortcut = `:r` - `:i` to get *info* on a type/declaration/function - `:t` to get *type* info on a declaration/function - `:k` to get *kind* info on a function
