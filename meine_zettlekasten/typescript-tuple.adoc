= Tuples

Tuples can be declared as: `const myTuple: [string, int] = ["Brendon", 100]`

Breaking first it down we have our declaration syntax followed by the name of our variable Nothing strange here Then we have our type annotation followed by what looks like an array of types This is how TypeScript knows it's a tuple Without the array of types next to it the compiler would think of the value as an array of a certain type
