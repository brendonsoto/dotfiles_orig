I'm trying out Obsidian
Making some notes for myself on shortcuts to better get acclimated to it

## To explore
### Shortcuts / Default settings
Can I export/use some default config w/ my preferences w/o having to set them every time?

Yes! Within a vault there's an `.obsidian` directory that holds configuration data. Just copy that to other vaults.

### Vim integration
- what functionality is available?

not sure there's a definite list, but it seems to be anything [CodeMirror uses](https://codemirror.net/demo/vim.html)

### What does this have that Vim does not?
This is mostly for me to consider what to use going forward-ish

I do really like the table of contents to the right and the tags view
