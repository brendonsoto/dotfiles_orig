# Routine
# Pain Points
I need to develop my pinky and ring finger
Figure out a schedule similar to how you workout

# IMPORTANT
Be mindful of what you want to accomplish/need
As an example:
Do you _need_ to practice trills all the way up by the 20th fret?

# Pre Practice
Think of it like the warm ups from Fitness Blender
Do what you're going to do at a relaxed pace
Do this for ~10min


# Legato
RELAX
When playing, make sure to relax

## Two Fingers
Trills:
- IM
- IR
- IP
- MR
- MP
- RP

Need to practice these in different positions
Steve Stine suggests 20 seconds each
I'm going to start off 10 seconds each, 2 or 3 reps

## Three Fingers
- 124
- 134
- 124 (spread - [frets: 1-3-5])

The goal is evenness in pressure between all fingers
If the pressure isn't consistent between some of the fingers, go back to practicing the two finger trills with those
