# Different states of priority recruit different neural representations in visual working memory
[source](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000769)

# tl;dr
Information in the brain can have different priorities which can determine how that information is processed.

# Abstract
The brain represents thoughts/information of different priorities in similar ways.
When given multiple things of different priority, the lesser priority thoughts are rotated (think like rotating a hexagon from one quadrant of a coordinate plane to another).

# Intro
Different bits of information at different priority levels can be held in the brain. The highest level of priority info is the focus of attention while the rest of the info is stored in "activated long-term memory" or "region of direct access". Sounds like RAM for a computer to me.

There have been observations made that suggest higher priority info is processed differently than lower priority info.

# Other
Skipping a lot of the other sections because a lot of it does not make sense to me but seems to be technical information. I'm trying to hone in on the big pictures.

# Methods
- 14 individuals in the study

# Quotes
From the intro:
>  Thus, the current study was designed to assess evidence for a priority-based remapping at 2 novel levels of representation: the item-specific “identity” of oriented-grating stimuli and the trial-unique “context” of each stimulus, operationalized as location.
