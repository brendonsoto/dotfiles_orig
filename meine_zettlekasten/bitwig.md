Mental place for things/tips/tricks

# Devices with multiple outs
If a device has multiple outputs (think Digitone w/ Overbridge) click on the device pane and click on the small icon with two arrows (it should be within the title bar of the plugin). There'll be some message asking if you'd like to add "missing chains". Click yes.


# HW Instrument
Make sure that the MIDI channel set is the channel the device is listening for!


# Polyphony / Monophony
In my mind, there are two ways of toggling polyphony.

The first way:
- FUNC + TRIG to get to the Setup menu
- Nav down to PLAY MODE
- Switch between Poly, Poly M.LFO (Monophonic LFO), Mono, Mono Legato

The second way:
- Unison
- Switch locked voices to just one voice


# Layering
To see this, press the unison button, the one with the mouth shape on it.
In the bottom right there will be a layer display.
This pairs other tracks' sounds to the current so you can play multiple timbres from one track.
One creative thing to do with this is use one track as the main note sequencer and the other tracks as parameter locks.
