# HW Instrument
Make sure that the MIDI channel set is the channel the device is listening for!

# Devices with multiple outs
If a device has multiple outputs (think Digitone w/ Overbridge) click on the device pane and click on the small icon with two arrows (it should be within the title bar of the plugin). There'll be some message asking if you'd like to add "missing chains". Click yes.
