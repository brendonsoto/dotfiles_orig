= IHP

This is basically Rails for Haskell Gotta admit it seems pretty neat It is based on nix rather than stack which is interesting

I first heard about this at Odeko, 2021/Jul/8 (Only reason I know this is because I created this post the next day) One concern was whether this would work nicely on macOS since at the time nix was a bit odd to use on macOS due to updates from BigSur (I think it had to do with Kernel permissions)

I'm going through the "Your First Project" tutorial (https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/your-first-project.html) as a guinea pig to make sure the framework is workable on a mac w/ an intel processor So far so good!

= Quirks/Oddities I noticed

There's usage of the `make` command (i.e.
`make psql` for postgres session w/ the app's db or `make -B .envrc` to make sure new dependencies are in) but the Makefile seems pretty light Also, seems a bit hard to find the postgres configuration
