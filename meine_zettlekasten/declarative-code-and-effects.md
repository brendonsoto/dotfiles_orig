> This is not an easy topic, because understanding some of the best solutions requires you to see the deep commonalities in code across different use cases. So I will deliberately start from basic principles and jump a few domains. Sorry, it's unavoidable

I love how this is one of the starting sentences. Acknowledging the interconnectedness of things.

- it is often not understood what declarative programming means
  - people often use what its not to describe it (ie its not OOP)
- to help prevent the anti-patterns of not declarative code:
  - linters
  - learn to say No to repeating legacy code just because lf consistency
  - **understand the pain points declarative programming avoids**
