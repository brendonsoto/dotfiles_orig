- git merge origin/<_branch i'm currently on_>
- easy tmux toggle between three panes (code, run, test) and just code
- some sort of constant notifier in the background for blinking
- persistent/harassing reminders
  - like if you swipe away or anything, it'll remind you again in 5
  - maybe even after you hit done, another reminder in 5 to say "Did you really do < activity > just five minutes ago?"
  - get more comfortable w/ `ripgrep`
  - get more comfortable w/ `find`
  - shortcut to open files from `git st`
  - something like `nix`/`docker` but for development on a mac
  - get more familiar with `git rebase`
    - how can I prevent multiple conflicts when rebasing? i.e. rebasing a work branch ontop of stage and multiple conflicts per stage of the rebasing
