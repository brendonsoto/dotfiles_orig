= Alter Schema After Generation

Say you've created a schema, controller, and views using: `mix phx.gen.html Accounts User users name:string, email:string`

You add the `resources` snippet as the instructions tell you to

_Do not_ run `mix ecto.migrate` yet

You then add password fields to the schema like so:

`+ schema "users" do   ...
field :password, :string, virutal: true   field :password_hash, :string end +`

And you change the migrations file to include the `password_hash` alongside any unique constraints

``` def change   create table(:users) do     \...
add :password_hash, :string   end

create unique_index(:users, [:email]) end ```

You _now_ run `mix ecto.migrate` And now your tests should run successfully.

If you were to add in the migrations prior to making the schema + db changes then they will fail with db errors
