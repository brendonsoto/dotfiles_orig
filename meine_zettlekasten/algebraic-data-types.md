# Algebraic Data Types

## What are algebraic data types?
Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) are data types that you can make by combining other data types.
It is possible to combine other data types using statements such as "and" and "or".
Such types are called [[product-types|Product Types]] and [[sum-types|Sum Types]] respectively.

The impact of algebraic data types can be reasoned about with the help of [[cardinality]].
