# How Fascism Works
# The Mythic Past
A mythic past is described as an incomplete or false narrative idolizing some set of values that may not have exactly existed in order to change the present.

The goal of this narrative is to encourage "authoritarianism, hierarchy, purity, and struggle". This is done through highlighting patriarchy and language to create some separation cultivating in a sense of "us" and "them". This separation could be based on race, religion, culture, etc. Language and a fabricated past assist in hiding parts of history inconvenient and/or inconsistent with the story the fascist party is trying to create. If successful, such a story could lead people of the country to also deny parts of their past. This in turn can create some sense of struggle through a sense of unfair treatment.

# Propaganda
Propaganda is used to mask intentional harmful policies under the guise of being virtuous.

Democracy is used as a vehicle for fascist parties to strengthen their foothold. They may launch campaigns of anticorruption, but the corruption they question is a corruption of their ideals, which usually is some case involving purity.

Hypocrisy is amok within the party.

# Anti-Intellectual
Fascists target universities and aim to control them in order to promote the mythical past, figures important to the fascist regime, and the fascist ideals. The only important view to the fascist is the dominant one

# Unreality
Unreality here means a state where people do not feel trust in their nation. This is dangerous because instead of using reason most will go with whatever is most consistent. They will also place their trusts in certain sources which can further lead to the mess. This is only further worsened by knowing that politicians speak with abstractions to hide their ideals. As a result politicians are known for being insincere so a candidate who speaks their mind, even if incorrect, will come off as more authentic and more appealing.

# Hierarchy
Essentially, a power struggle. Fascists argue that hierarchy is natural. This leads to a justification of one group being superior to the other. There are other activities essentially trying to legitimize this like race science. 

This particular area is tricky because both the left and right disagree with programs to even the playing field between marginalized groups and the comfortable.

# Victimhood
Victimhood is used to create a sense of group identity which assists in cultivating nationalism. From here, acts of oppression are somehow justified by a false premise that boils down to maintaining some state of purity. Fascists also confuse the idea of equality with dominance, viewing acts to level the playing field between different social groups as power grabs.

? - Still don't super understand how they can mistake a service to level the playing field as trying to dominate. Its like theres no reflection on the non-marginalized group

# Law and Order
Law and order in a fascist group refers to the separation of people into those that fit within the fascist group and those that do not. The latter category is labeled as "criminals" and are persecuted against. As more of a certain group is incarcerated the general population views the group as naturally immoral.

It's a ruse to preserve and ensure purity.

# Sexual Anxiety
Fascists fear people of different races, religions, sexuality, etc from reproducing together, seeing it as "impure" breeding. This interferes with their notion of purity. LGBTQA+ also promotes worry for the fascist because it throws their idea of patriarchy out.

# Sodom and Gomorrah
Fascism is more supported in rural areas than in cities. Rural areas are thought as the backbone, where hard work was done. People in rural areas are considered self-sufficient. Cities are known for those that don't fit in with the fascist ideals. Rural areas are where support is cultivated for fascists.

# Arbeit Macht Frei
The phrase translates to "Hard work will make you free". This is the false pretense fascists use to put people outside of their group to work, justifying the idea of a hierarchy.
