= Overloaded Functions

It is possible to overload functions in TypeScript in a weird way.
It's not exactly overloading because you cannot create multiple function implementations But you can specify, almost pattern match against, values

For example: ``` function parkCar(type: "tesla"): void;
function parkCar(type: "ford"): void;
function parkCar(type: "bmw"): void;

function parkCar(type: string): void {   alert(`+Parked your ${type}+`) } ``` Notice the three different function headers and how they all have different values for the `type` parameter If you were to call this function with a `type` value not specified in the headers it would error out
