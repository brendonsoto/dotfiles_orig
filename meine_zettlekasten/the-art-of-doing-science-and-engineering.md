# Foreword
- gifts to humanity -- i.e. books teaching the knowledge instead of knowledge hidden behind error-correcting.com API
- science and engineering as public service
- cannot learn to think by talking in abstract, but by learning from others how they think and approached their problems

# Preface
- uses analogy of art teachers teaching
    - advanced students paint, teachers walk around and mention what else could be done, what approach the teacher would've taken, and more
    - makes me think of the tikTok of the guy saying big learning opportunities come out of being shocked by something, and to be shocked you need someone else to tell you that which you did not know, to shock you
- teaching "style" of engineering

# Introduction
- focused on future, not past
- book is drawn from Hammings experiences
- foundation is needed to point out flaws and suggest improvements 

# 1 Orientation
- study successes more than failures since there are fewer successes than failures
- take elements of style from others and use it in creating **your own**
- what may be successful in one generation may not be successful in another generation
- difference between _education_ and _training_
    - "Education is what, when, and why to do things. Training is how to do it."
    - both are necessary. you can't do something you don't know how to do
- i usually think learn the what and then the how but Hamming is saying the learning here must be based on reflecting on past experiences and knowledge
- there is a constant need to learn things because of an overall (like, observing over years) growth in scientists
- "back of the envelope calculations" = quick way to validate ideas and find potential holes in your thinking
    - reminds me of Saul trying to teach us to have an intuition and not focus too much on the equations
- knowledge has a rough half life of 15 years
- focus on the fundamentals of the _time_
    - dont be left behind over time
    - "Thus I am a veteran of learning enough to get along without at the same time devoting all my effort to learning new topics and thereby not contributing my share to the total effort of the organization."
        - i don't aggree with this. cant you advance a field or topic by focusing on just it?
