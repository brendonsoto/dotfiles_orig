Logging how i am responding to the medication

---
2021/Jul/8
- my mind feels like a calm river
- i was having a convo with a colleague over slack/IM and actually waited for a response instead of bouncing around to different apps
- my leg bouncing calmed a bit, still kicked in when I was super focused on something, but I don't feel compelled to do so as often
- I was on linkedIn accepting my boss' invitation, began scrolling, and was able to stop myself after 3 posts to tell myself "this isn't something I want to do"
- Was in a meeting for 30 minute on a topic that doesn't super excite me but I was able to pain attention pretty dang well and take rather connected notes (still got haphazard at the end but not bad)
- it's 2:32 now -- i'm wondering if it's wearing off a bit now. I did notice my leg start shaking a lot more now. I was still able to focus on things that weren't super interesting though (the query thing for Delilah)
- 3:27pm -- i think it's still in my system. I'm able to write smaller sentences, not run ons. I noticed this when trying to revise my notes from earlier meeting.
- 10:17pm -- i am absolutely sure the the medication has worn off now. I was on a 1.5 hour talk w/ Ryan and did my tangential/run-on sentence talking. however, at the end of the work day i did find myself with more energy, not completely exhausted. I touched my synth and was able to focus on it again. I felt more apt to do music.
- still 10:17-ish -- Reflecting on my energy and wanting to do music makes me wonder if energy management is really key for me. Like, do I want to do music more because I feel I have more energy? Do I feel I have more energy because my thoughts aren't everywhere? My meals today were okay. Oatmeal w/ blueberries and dark chocolate for breakfast, friend's enchilada for lunch w/ a green drink (celery, spinach, kale, lime, etc. -- i felt i needed a green), fruits and a cookie for snacks, and then brick oven pizza + mediterannean appetizers for lucnh

IDEA:
Make a Haskell CLI app for logging this stuff?
But I'd probably want a UI for it.
Or maybe like a vim wiki thing for it?
Should I make a separate vimwiki for it?
A vimwiki of other vimwikis?

So far okay
It's interesting, I think I can feel a switch where my brain feels less cluttered, less noisy

11:17am
I felt pretty focused through finishing up the turotial for the new haskell web framework
I have noticed I have dry mouth more.
I noticed a similar thing the other day but thought it was because I was thirsty and/or hungry for a snack
