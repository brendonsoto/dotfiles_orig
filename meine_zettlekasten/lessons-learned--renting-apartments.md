# Renting in NYC
As of writing lived in two condos
Currently applying to another condo
Their process is by far the most complicated:
- ~90 page packet
- 2 personal references
- 2 professional/financial references
- providing statements of all financial info including:
  - checking account
  - savings account
  - 401k
  - stocks

Sometimes a broker will act as a liason between the unit owner, the board, and the renter

For next time:
- double check if they need statements for any financial docs
