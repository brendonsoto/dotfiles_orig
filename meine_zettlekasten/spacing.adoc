= Spacing

:css-quirks:

== Child Takes up Full Width of Padded Parent

Consider the following: ```
// HTML+++<main class="parent">+++I am a child+++</main>+++

// CSS
.parent {   padding: 0 20px;
width: 1000px;
} ```

When this renders the child component will have space around it Say you want the child element to sit snuggly with the parent and touch its corners Usually I tried to shy away from padding on a parent element and instead put it on each of the child elements A better way may be through negative margins: `
// CSS
.child {   margin: 0 -20px;
} ` Notice the margin is _the same value_ as the padding of the parent, _but negated_ Also notice that _no width was applied_ to the child, no `width: 100%;`
