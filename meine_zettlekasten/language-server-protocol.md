# Language Server Protocol
I'd like to learn more about this and it's implementation
Details https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/overviews/lsp/overview/

At first, I thought I'd use Vim + Ale as a lens to examine and study this, but am having second thoughts. My doubts are due to the bad reputation vimscript/VimL has and also how vimscript/VimL is limited just to Vim. I figured that if I'd like to study this I should do so with an implementation in either a language I know or want to learn.
