# Contestants
I'm going back and forth between:
- textile
- reStructuredText
- asciidoc

One of these is to be used with https://github.com/lervag/wiki.vim as a sort of wiki/personal knowledge management tool

# Criteria
Things important to me:
- easy headings
- easy unordered lists (that can be nested using the same keycode)
- links
- tooling

# Headings
I like asciidoc and textile in regards to this

reStructuredText is flexible, but I dont like how you can use anything for it. I like rules for it.

# Lists
## Unordered
Once again i like asciidoc and textile better
they both have the same structure
ReStructuredText requires blank lines between items, which i hate



## Ordered
Same deal
One exception is that Asciidoc has a slight advantage since tgeres syntax for easily switching different types of enumeration (i.e. numbers, capital letters, lowercase letters, roman nums, etc)

# Links
At this point im only comparing Textile and Asciidoc

## Internal
Textile is much simpler, but theres **a lot** of flexibility with asciidoc

asciidoc seems a bit more odd. internal links are different than textile


## External
Both are easy


# Tooling
Im looking for
- autocompletion of ids to link to
- table of contents generation
- a way to see the outline of the doc
- vim editting

The outline part I can probably scrap togetger something with ctags + tagbar
