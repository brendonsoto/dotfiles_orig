# Contestants
I'm going back and forth between:
- textile
- reStructuredText
- asciidoc

One of these is to be used with https://github.com/lervag/wiki.vim as a sort of wiki/personal knowledge management tool

# Criteria
Things important to me:
- easy headings
- easy unordered lists (that can be nested using the same keycode)
- links

# Headings
I like asciidoc and textile in regards to this

reStructuredText is flexible, but I dont like how you can use anything for it. I like rules for it.

# Lists
## Unordered

## Ordered

# Links
## Internal
## External
