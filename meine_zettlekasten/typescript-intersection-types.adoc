= Intersection Types

Think of intersection types as types connected through the use of _and_.
A type is this _and_ that.
Intersection types are _sum_ types.
Use them when you're combining two types (i.e.
while using `Object.assign`)

For mnemonic purposes, think of the intersection of two types.

The syntax for it would be like so: ``` interface One {   name: string } interface Two {   num: number }

const Three: One & Two = {   name: "MyName",   num: 7 } ```
