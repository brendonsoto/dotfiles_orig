= How to squash commits

* First find the number of commits you want to squash together (i.e.
since master and your current changes)
* `git rebase -i HEAD~<num-commits>` *OR* `git rebase -i <commit-sha>`
* At this point the editor should open up and you'll see `pick` on the left side with teh commits on the side
* Leave the first `pick` alone
* Change the others underneath to `s` or `squash`
* Save and leave the file
* The editor will open w/ a screen to edit the message
