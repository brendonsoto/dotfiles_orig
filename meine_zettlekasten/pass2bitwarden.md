# Pass to Bitwarden
:projects:


This is a project to get more familiar (or at this point back into) [Haskell](haskell). The goal is to convert my passwords from one tool (pass) to a csv file for another (bitwarden). I'm writing my thoughts down to game plan and talk ideas out.

I realize I don't really know what I'm doing and am learning as I'm going and am completely fine with that despite knowing I'll probably be quite frustrated by this later on.


## Gameplan

- [X] Create a script that can read a directory
- [X] Write the output of the files into a file
- [ ] Look into calling a function from a Haskell script
