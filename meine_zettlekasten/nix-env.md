# Nix Env
[kudos](https://rgoswami.me/posts/ccon-tut-nix/)

Not sure what the right name for this is but this is about:
- nix-shell
- nix-env
Basically managing an environment with Nix

Three tools that improve upon the Nix experience:
- `Nox` -- apparently a better package manager
- `Niv` -- used to pin versions
- `lorri` --
- `direnv` --

So nix-env seems like a sort of package manager
Nix searches a local or online repository of packages


# Installing other deps with nix-env
`nix-env -i <dep>`


# Installing deps with nox
`nox <dep>`


# nix-shell
Apparently the default shell is `bash`


# Shell hooks


# Questions
- So what exactly is `nix-env`
