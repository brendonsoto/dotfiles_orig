= Command Line Dictionary

:ideas:

I'd like to build a command line dictionary app referencing the Merriam Webster dictionary.
Why MW?
Because that's what I've used for a while.
Why a CLI app?
Because I really like being able to search for the definition of words using OS X's finder shortcut and would like something like that for Linux.
I also figured it would be a neat thing to have.
Plus, avoid ads!

I'm thinking about doing it in link:Haskell[haskell]
