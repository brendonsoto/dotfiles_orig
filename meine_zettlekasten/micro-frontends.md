# Micro Frontends
[Source](https://micro-frontends.org/)

The target audience of this approach seems to be companies with multiple teams to ship features independently.
This seems to be an alternative to the usual SPA
The mindset is thinking about your front end as a series of features

Q1: What about when features overlap or use similar utility functions?

Teams are cross functional and work end-to-end
There's a diagram that shows different teams in separate columns driving the idea of these teams acting independently
I have a hard time believing this thinking about the continuity of the look and feel of the app
This translates to shared components/styles which means the teams will probably share a layer of code still
What separates this from having a single front end?
