# Cardinality
:cardinality:

The names have to do with a concept called *cardinality* which represents the number of possibilities a type can be.
For instance, the `Bool` type has a cardinality of two since it only has two values: `True` and `False`.
Types related to numbers, like `Int`, have a cardinality based on the computer.
The cardinality would be different between a 32-bit and a 64-bit machine since they have different limits.

The cool thing about cardinality is that it helps you think about the different values that a function could take.
So it's like a reasoning tool.

Cardinality also plays a role in reasoning about [[sum-types|sum types]] and [[product-types|product types]].
