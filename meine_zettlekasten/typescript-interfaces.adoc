= Interfaces

Interfaces can be used as an alternate way to describe the types of objects

The syntax for them is as follows: ` interface Car {   manufacturer: string;
year: number;
} ` Notice the semicolon after each property/value pair.

They can be _imported_ and _exported_ just like regular objects.

Interfaces can _extend_ each other Example: `interface SUV extends Car { seats: number;
}`

When a function uses an interface as its type, the _types of the parameters can be omitted_ Example: `+const parkCar: Car = (_manufacturer, _year) => { ...
}+`

Interfaces can be merged if multiple are defined Example: ` interface Car {   manufacturer: string;
} interface Car {   year: number;
} ` This will provide an interface that includes both properties

Tests can be written for your types using _dtslint_

== When to use

Use interfaces to describe the shapes of anything that is an object which includes: - Objects - Functions - Arrays
