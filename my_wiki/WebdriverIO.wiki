= WebdriverIO =

I hate testing.
But I love that it helps me check myself before I wreck myself.

== WebdriverIO -- Chrome + Node ==
1. Follow the installation instructions [here](http://webdriver.io/guide.html)
2. Download Chromedriver [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
3. Put Chromedriver in your $PATH
4. Launce webdriver as so: $ java -jar -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=chromedriver selenium-server-standalone-3.5.3.jar
5. You're set!
