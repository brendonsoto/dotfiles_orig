= Project 4 =
- [X] Mult
- [X] Fill

== Mult ==
So we need to simulate a way of multiplying.
What is multiplying? It's repeated addition.
So we can use one number as a counter and the other as what to add.

Pseudocode:
Let num0 = a
Let num1 = b
Let product = c

While a > 0:
  c = c + num1

== Fill ==
Pseduocode:

While true:
  If a key is pressed:
    Write 'black' to the screen
  Else:
    Write 'white' to the screen

There are two components involved:
- Screen
  - 256 x 512
  - @ RAM[16384]
  - @Screen as variable representing the screen?
- Keyboard
  - @ RAM[24576]
