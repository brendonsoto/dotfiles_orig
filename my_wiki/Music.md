## Lesson Plan
Using Jamplay...

### Beginner track
We're starting at the basiscs again just to be sure we've got the foundation down.
I won't be doing all of the videos, but select ones.

Start with:
*David MacKenzie*
- [X] Lesson 5: Speed and Coordination
- [X] Lesson 6: Chord Exercises
- [X] Lesson 7: Practice and Discipline
- [ ] Lesson 8: Double Stops << I didn't think the concept was explained adequately
- [X] Lesson 9: The Major Chords << Non-barre forms.
- [X] Lesson 10: The Minor Chords
- [ ] Lesson 11: Major Scales << Saw the first half, stopped midway. Just showed a different way to play the scale on the low 3 strings.
      ^ Even though I didn't go through it, I do see the value of the other form and that makes me think I should look into practicing different forms on the same starting notes
- [ ] Lesson 12: Major Scale Jam << Skipped/Watched half. Just iterating through the diff major scale patterns up the neck (i.e. E, F, G, A, B, C, D)
- [ ] Lesson 13: The Minor Scales << Skipping based on Major scale lesson
- [ ] Lesson 14: Minor Scale Jam << Skipping based on Major scale lesson
- [ ] Lesson 15: One String Exercise << Skipping. Just practicing minor scale on high e in triplets
- [ ] Lesson 21: Practicing Bends << Skipped. Confirms what I know
- [X] Lesson 22: Basic Vibrato << Nice, but little vague, summary of bend styles
- [X] Lesson 23: Pentatonic Scale << Similar to Major/Minor scale demos. Just 3 string pattern starting at low E
- [X] Lesson 24: Minor Pentatonic Scale
- [X] Lesson 26: Full Minor Scale << Different presentation of the scale. Not much different from what i know.
- [X] Lesson 27: Full Major Pentatonic Scale
- [X] Lesson 28: Full Minor Pentatonic Scale
- [X] Lesson 30: Rhythm Basics
- [X] Lesson 31: Power Chord Variations
- [X] Lesson 33: Tapping Exercise << skimmed most since its just intro to tapping
- [X] Lesson 34: Tapping Exercise #2 << skimmed to since it was just based off on the other
- [ ] Lesson 35: Tapping #3: Adding Open Strings << Skipped since seems similar to other
- [ ] Lesson 36: Tapping #4: Diminished Lick << Skipped since seems similar to other
- [ ] Lesson 37: Tapping #5
- [X] Lesson 39: Tapping #6 << Was very similar to others, but just with more strings
- [X] Lesson 40: Chord Structures << * This was actually neat. Showed the same chord with different chord structures. I.e. using F-chord at the 12th to get another D
- [X] Lesson 41: Octaves

Summary:
I thought this was a great different perspective on what I know. Although I knew most of the material, a lot of it was presented in a different perspective. I guess a better way of putting is, I knew the material one way, but the parts I didn't skip in this lesson provided an alternate way to doing whatever material the lesson was on. The biggest takeaway I think I have here is to start small and really make sure I've got the concept down. This insight came from the Full Major Pentatonic lesson. I know the minor pentatonic scale, not the major, but still wanted to make sure I got it down. It was a simple two-octave scale run, but instead of just learning the pattern, being able to go up and down it, I made a backing track with the scale and just goof'd solo'd over it. I feel pretty confident with it.
