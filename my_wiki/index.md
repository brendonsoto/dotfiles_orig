# My Wikiblog

Wikiblog? Yeah, I know. I couldn't come up with anything better at the moment. This is just a space to record my thoughts and reflections on tech/code stuff.

## Random Thoughts
Could we learn about scalability from nature?
A tree grows both vertically (height) and horizontally (branches/width). Plus there are so many branches to a tree, each seemingly going its own way. There must be some system for balancing itself out. How does a tree's branches grow without the tree itself becoming lopsided?
A tree has leaves to provide nutrition to too. Water soaks in through the roots, up the branches, to the leaves, correct? And there are so many leaves per branch. How is nutrition distributed across the whole tree?
Does a tree branch ever split into three? like -|- ? Branch splits always seem like one branch is the main while the other is the secondary.


## Scratchpad


## with Dennis
We-Will-For
"We Will"  = list action items

Rationale for why to make tickets out of Problems/Refactor moments instead of just doing it in the moment:
- If you have to roll back, you don't have to worry about the rollback removing more than just the intended code
- Incremental releases

Github pull request template,

add certain sections, mor eso for the developer, to make them aware of what they have to check for


IF you're the sole owner of some information, next time a ticket comes up for said information, pair with someone who *does not* kno wit

mob pr = scheduling a PR review session with multiple people for the team. The person who writes it talks through the mindset used in creating the commit/diff

Hour befoer morning team meet, do a PR

An interesting dynamic between dev and product,
prior info: their board consists of an "icebox" which are things the devs noticed that need to get done
Produce looks at stuff in th eicebox, asks Dev how important is the said ticket is it important, and mor edetails on it
"The manager manages time"

knowns:
- feature flags are a thing
- Multiple states per item (x8)

Tile Structure:
- Loading state (Takes up all tile)
- Head (Optional)
- Body
- Footer (OPtional - 1 or 2 CTAS)

Feature:
Redesign of Tiles on the homepage
- Foundation:
  - add flag
  - add base "styling"
- P1:
  - state 1 -- 4:
- P2:
  - State 5 -- 8

- Foundation: << has to be QA'd + merged to master
  - s1
  - s2
  - ...
  - s8

For Styling ... use BEM, and make a class per state/different thing. If things are similar between the same mixins.

"I get the idea of using React components... but we're building an experience and an experience requiers things to be universal"

Sass stuff/ styling
IN sass you can make sutt /variables to be exported by javascript
Look into SASS maps
