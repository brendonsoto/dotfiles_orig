# React Project Generator
Just had an idea for a project, a way of correlating a site map + code structure.
What if there was a document that acted as a sitemap, but in a list form. I.E.:
- Home
  - News
    - Local
    - Worldwide
  - Stats
  - Games
    - Web
    - Mobile
    - Console
  - Contact
And from there you'd enter in a command, idk, `react-site-create template.md` you'd get
/views/pages/home
/views/pages/news/local
/views/pages/news/worldwide
/views/pages/
