Input files are all markdown style (or maybe vimwiki too?)
Output transforms the markdown pages into html elements, not pages
Base file imports whatever file is mentioned on click

WHy?
I like filesystems and I write content in short blurbs anyways.
I feel like such a design would make the note-style content okay presentation-wise
Like people would click a link and see half-thought-out thoughts/writing and be okay with that.
