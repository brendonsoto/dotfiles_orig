# Beginning
[Reading Simple Haskell](https://soupi.github.io/rfc/reading_simple_haskell/) is a super cool resource for getting up to speed with Haskell syntax.

[Writing Simple Haskell](https://soupi.github.io/rfc/writing_simple_haskell/) also is super cool! I wish this resource was available or circulated more when I started learning Haskell. It would have made me more motivated to learn and actually try messing around to get simple programs working.

My main complaint with most learning processes for programming languages is that it takes a while to get to the point of actually making something. This seems very true with most Haskell learning resources.

[Learn You A Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) was great for _seeing_ what the fundamentals were, but there were no exercises or projects to use that knowledge in a guided context.

[Haskell from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/) is a really great text with a lot of examples and exercises, but often it feels like the exercises don't quite focus on the concept that was just learned. Thankfully it's not too frequent of a problem, but it throws a wrench in the system by making the reader question the usefulness of its exercises. Plus some of its content seems a bit outdated now (i.e. due to changes in GHC semigroup instances are now to be used to define `<>` instead of monoid instances which makes some of the examples and exercises confusing since semigroups are introduced after monoids) despite the book still not being finalized (at the time of writing).

I feel like projects are the way to go for learning programming. Learning things in isolation can be useful for theoretical reasons, but I think it's even more important to show how the cogs fit together and form the big picture. Maybe this way we could help programmers grow not only in language, but also with enhancing an engineering mindset.
