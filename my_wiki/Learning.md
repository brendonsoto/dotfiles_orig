# React Native - Learning

I'm going through the tutorials, but a few things I want to prime my mind with is learning how to:
- Get a prototype working on my phone
- Implement swipe functionality (maybe make a sort of counter with swiping?)
- Multiple menus


## Reflections
### Props
It's cool and refreshing that so far React Native doesn't seem too different than React. I'm intrigued by the View/Text/Image tags though. What do they encapsulate?
