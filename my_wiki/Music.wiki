Actually, think about what I really want... a nice studio option, but also a portable option
- Joyo Mjolnir Head
- Joyo Zombie Head << Would require an attenuator for multiple settings
- DV Mark Little 50 << Solid state, but did sound pretty good and cheaper than the rest
- Orange 1x8

Using Jamplay...

=== Beginner track ===
We're starting at the basiscs again just to be sure we've got the foundation down.
