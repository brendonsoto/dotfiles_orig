Imagine an app where every hour or whatever time period your computer will ask you if you're focused.

+----------------------+
| Are you focused now? |
|  _____     ____      |
| | yes |   | no |     |
|  -----     ----      |
+----------------------+

*If YES:*
The computer automatically notes down whatever apps you have open at the moment and whatever the main app is or whatever the most used app since the last checkup was.

*If NO:*
A dialog appears with a cheeky prompt
_Since you're already not focused, why not write down why you're not focused?_
Or have a list of radio buttons with one for "Other" and a text box to write why


The app can give you statistics and tell you what times you're most focused.
