I want to record at least two songs today.

= Preliminary stuff =
- [X] Learn how to load samples into the iPad drum sequencer
- [X] Check tone of guitar emulated output into the R16:
  - If it sucks, maybe cabinet would help?
- [ ] Check out sends and returns in the R16
- [ ] Figure out noise in guitar signal:
  - It changes as I walk around


= Patterning =
I figured out how to get samples in!
In the pattern screen, on the right hand bar, click the waveform tab and then click the waveform itself.
An "Import" button/option should appear.

One thing with Patterning though is that it allows only 8 samples.
So instead of using multiple samples for the same piece (i.e. high hat or snare) there's velocity instead.
But there is an option for multiple drum kits, but I'm not sure about the recording aspect of it.
Unfortunately you can't record switching the kits used, but least that makes it easier/simpler.

So I would need to construct my kit like a usual drum kit.
