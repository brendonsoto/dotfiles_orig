= What am I looking for =
- Tenkeyless or 60%
  - I think I like 60% more, but tenkeyless is definitely more versatile unless if it's a programmable one where I can make something like Fn + h/j/k/l = up/down/left/right
  - On second thought, while 60% would be cool I don't want to deal with having to memorize new configuration/key commands. I do that enough with vim

I like this one a lot [Varmilo VA87M]( https://shopkey.doyustudio.com/7l1wlsw-bb )
^I like the key caps on it a lot. That's the only thing. 

Pok3r looks nice too. Supports OS X, Linux, & Windows. Seems *programmable* too!
