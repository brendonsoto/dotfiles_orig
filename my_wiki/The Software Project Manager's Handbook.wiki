= The Software Project Manager's Handbook =

== Chapter 2 ==
One way to handle a project that's seen success is through a mixture of the following:
- Balancing People, Process, & Product
- Visibility
- Configuration Management
- Applying Standards with careful judgement

=== 2.1 The Three P's ===
The three P's stand for:
- People : who is building/maintaining the software
- Process : i.e. waterfall/agile, systems covering the how for scheduling programming
- Product : what is being built

How do they tie together?
You need to balance them.
Different products have different levels of difficulty and requirements.
In order to ge the job done, a proper mix of people and process is needed.
The chapter showed examples of projects like where the product is software the people/programmers are familiar coding so a waterfall process, or in other words a more straight-forward process system, can be used. Another example was a product that was foreign to the people/team. One solution would be to hire an external group who has experience building software like the product, but this would also require a different process than say training the existing team to build the product.

It's a system that strives to find the right mix of the capabilities of the people, the capabilities of the process, and the capability/complexity of the product.
