This was a really cool walkthrough on making an actually useful program! I forgot that you can use outside binaries in vim which is what this article was about! I do have a few questions though:

- What is `Data.Text` and what separates it from `String`?
- What is `Safe` and why is it useful?
- What is the difference between `import ...` and `import qualified ...`?
- Why does GHC need `-dynamic` when compiling stuff?
