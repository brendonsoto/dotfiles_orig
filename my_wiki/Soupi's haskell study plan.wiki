I've been going through Haskell from First Principles at a leisurely pace (around 20 minutes a day) for about four or five months now and while I have certainly learned a lot I have been frustrated by a few things from the book.

// NOTE Is this section necessary?
For example, I am currently on Chapter 15, which discusses monoids and semigroups, and ran into issues getting through the examples due to changes in GHC. More specifically, instances of `mappend` / (`<>`) are now to be declared as semigroup instances instead of monoid instances, but semigroups aren't explained until after monoids. StackOverflow helped me on that one.


// NOTE  This continues after "frustrated by a few things from the book."
I won't list those frustrations here as that will entail examples and derail this post. Instead, I wanted to try out "Get Programming with Haskell" by Will Kurt, but that costs money which I don't currently have so I'm going to try Soupi's guide! This will be my record of going through it.
