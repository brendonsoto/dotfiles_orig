# XMonad Config
In the case my wiki pages on xmonad are deleted, here is a sort of copy of them:

* xmonad.hs is to be symlinked to ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs
* xmonad.desktop is to be used for xfce and belongs in /usr/share/xsessions/xmonad.desktop


Make sure:

# ghc, xmonad, xmonad-contrib, xmobar are downloaded
# RECOMPILE XMONAD AFTER CHANGES
# Follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.haskell.org/Xmonad/Using_xmonad_in_XFCE#Configuring_XMonad_to_work_with_Xfce)
